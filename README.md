# rdr2-quest-notebook
A browser-based journal inspired by RDR2, letting outlaws log, edit, and track quests in a stylized UI. Add, edit, delete, and filter entries, view details in a modal, and preserve your progress across sessions using localStorage. Ride the frontier of DOM mastery, Red Dead style!
